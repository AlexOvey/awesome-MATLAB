## Commercial Toolboxes
*High quality commercial toolboxes*

* [Multiprecision Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.advanpix.com/) - The Multiprecision Computing Toolbox is the MATLAB extension for computing with arbitrary precision.  The toolbox equips MATLAB with a new multiple precision floating-point numeric type and extensive set of mathematical functions that are capable of computing with arbitrary precision.
* [NAG Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/MB/start.asp) - Over 1700 functions across numerous areas of numerical mathematics. Developed by The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).

## Free Toolboxes
*High quality free toolboxes*

* [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) - Chebfun is an open-source package for computing with functions to about 15-digit accuracy.
* [IFISS](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~djs/ifiss/) - IFISS is a graphical package for the interactive numerical study of incompressible flow problems which can be run under Matlab or Octave.
* [Wavelab](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/index_wavelab850.html) - WaveLab is a collection of Matlab functions that have been used by the authors and collaborators to implement a variety of algorithms related to wavelet analysis.
