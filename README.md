## 3rd Party Commercial Toolboxes
*High quality commercial toolboxes from organisations other than Mathworks*

* [Multiprecision Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.advanpix.com/) - The Multiprecision Computing Toolbox is the MATLAB extension for computing with arbitrary precision.  The toolbox equips MATLAB with a new multiple precision floating-point numeric type and extensive set of mathematical functions that are capable of computing with arbitrary precision.
* [NAG Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/MB/start.asp) - Over 1700 functions across numerous areas of numerical mathematics. Developed by The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).

## Database Management
*Toolboxes for managing data*

* [go-redis](https://github.com/markuman/go-redis/) - Redis Mex client for Matlab
* [mex-sqlite3](https://github.com/rmartinjak/mex-sqlite3) - Sqlite3 Mex client for Matlab

## Free Toolboxes
*High quality free toolboxes*

* [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) - Chebfun is an open-source package for computing with functions to about 15-digit accuracy.
* [IFISS](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~djs/ifiss/) - IFISS is a graphical package for the interactive numerical study of incompressible flow problems which can be run under Matlab or Octave.
* [Wavelab](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/index_wavelab850.html) - WaveLab is a collection of Matlab functions that have been used by the authors and collaborators to implement a variety of algorithms related to wavelet analysis.
* [emgr](http://gramian.de) - Empirical gramian framework for model reduction and system identification.
* [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/) - The VLFeat open source library implements popular computer vision algorithms specializing in image understanding and local features extraction and matching.It is written in C for efficiency and compatibility, with interfaces in MATLAB for ease of use, and detailed documentation throughout.
* [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) - MatConvNet is a MATLAB toolbox implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple, efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Many pre-trained CNNs for image classification, segmentation, face recognition, and text detection are available.
* [Piotr's Image and Video Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox) - This toolbox is meant to facilitate the manipulation of images and video in Matlab. Its purpose is to complement, not replace, Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox, and in fact it requires that the Matlab Image Toolbox be installed.

## Games
