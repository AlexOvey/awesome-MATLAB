## Commercial Toolboxes
*High quality commercial toolboxes*

* [Multiprecision Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.advanpix.com/) - The Multiprecision Computing Toolbox is the MATLAB extension for computing with arbitrary precision.  The toolbox equips MATLAB with a new multiple precision floating-point numeric type and extensive set of mathematical functions that are capable of computing with arbitrary precision.
* [NAG Toolbox for MATLAB](http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/MB/start.asp) - Over 1700 functions across numerous areas of numerical mathematics. Developed by The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).

## Free Toolboxes
*High quality free toolboxes*

* [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) - Chebfun is an open-source package for computing with functions to about 15-digit accuracy.

## Interfacing with other languages

* [Fortran mex routines](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/write-fortran-mex-files.html) - Fortran mex routines allow you to call Fortran code from within MATLAB.
* [MATLAB Engine for Python](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/get-started-with-matlab-engine-for-python.html) - The MATLAB Engine for Python provides a Python package named matlab that enables you to call MATLAB functions from Python.

## MATLAB Clones
*MATLAB-like environments*

* [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) - GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It can run many MATLAB programs unmodified.
* [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/) - Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications.
